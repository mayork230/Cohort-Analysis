## Overview
This project involves performing Cohort Analysis to understand customer retention over time. The analysis helps identify patterns in customer behavior, track retention rates, and guide data-driven decisions for improving user engagement and reducing churn.

The dashboard visualizes both Cohort Retention Rates and Cohort Tables, helping businesses see how customer retention evolves month by month across different cohorts.
## Data Source
I got this dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is an Online Retail Store which contains 13 columns. InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice. The original data contains 541,909 rows which after cleaning reduced to 392,669 rows. SQL was used to clean the dataset to remove inconsistencies and irrelevant data. Tableau was used to visualize the final results in chart to derive insights.
